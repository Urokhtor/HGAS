This folder contains the Arduino code which interfaces with hardware.
Arduino listens for incoming traffic from the Python server and then
performs routines according to the message protocol.

It is rather stable and safe to use, but not ready yet. However there shouldn't be any
dangerous bugs left that could break the system.

Note that this library needs some third party libraries to work, mainly for reading data from
different types of sensors. I don't own any copyrights to these libraries and without the
hard work of the authors Naga Automation Suite wouldn't work. So I want to thank all the
authors of these third party libraries for their work and their kindness to make their
libraries open source so projects like NAS can use them.

Third party libraries:
aJson - Copyright (c) 2010, Interactive Matter, Marcus Nowotny
    - JSON implementation for Arduino.
    - Used to make the messaging protocol work.

BMP085 - Written by Limor Fried/Ladyada for Adafruit Industries
    - Library for the BMP085 barometric pressure + temperature sensor.

dallas_temperature_control
    - Library for the DS18B20 temperature sensor.
    - Requires the OneWire library to work.

OneWire -
    - Library that allows Arduino to interface with OneWire protocol sensors like the DS18B20.

DHT11 - by George Hadjikyriacou
    - Library for the DHT11 humidity and temperature sensor.

HCSR04Ultrasonic - by Carl Nobile
    - Library for the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor

MemoryFree
    - Tells the user how many free kilobytes of memory are left.
    - Used for debugging.
