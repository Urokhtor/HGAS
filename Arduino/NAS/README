This folder contains the Arduino code which interfaces with hardware.
Arduino listens for incoming traffic from the Python server and then
performs routines according to the message protocol.

This work is at pre-alpha stage. It's not really safe to use yet.

Note that in order to use this library, certain third party libraries are needed because
of the sensors: OneWire and DallasTemperature for DS18B20 and DHT11 for the DHT11 humidity/temperature
sensor. These libraries need to be in their own folders in the Arduino /../sketchbook/library/

Also this pre-alpha stage is using MemoryFree for debugging. MemoryFree (found in the Arduino reference)
needs to be saved in the same folder with all the files included in this library.
