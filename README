Naga Automation Suite is a free and open source cross-platform project that aims to make home and garden automation
cheap and easy to use. Currently it consists of a server written with Python that handles serving the web front end,
managing the automation logic and controlling the microcontroller layer which interacts with hardware.

I apologise that the documentation is badly inadequate. Improvements will follow once I feel that the codebase is in
a releasable state.

Installation (More detailed instructions to follow):
1. You need to install Python 3 on your server.
2. Install matplotlib (for plotting graphs).
3. You need an Arduino Mega (or an equal) and the W5100 Ethernet shield.
4. Download the project.
    a) Move the files in Arduino directory in your Arduino sketchbook's libraries directory.
    b) Move the Naga Automation Suite directory wherever you wish to run it from.
5. Upload the Arduino skectch to your Arduino.
    a) ... SOMETHING ABOUT THE SERVER IP
6. Run Core.py from Naga Automation Suite to add an user and define the IP of your server.
    a) ... WRITE MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS
7. Start NAS with python Core.py (or python3 Core.py depending on your system).
8. Access the web front end from the IP you defined. NAS uses HTTPS and the default port is 8080.
